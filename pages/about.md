I am a Master of Urban Spatial Analytics student at University of Pennsylvania. I completed my undergraduate in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at University College London.

I am passionate about society, especially the history of nations' development and social forces that shape our lives. I am also interested in acquring essential data skills that will advance my understanding of society and decision-making.
